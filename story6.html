        <p>On a hot summer day, a fox wandered across the jungle in order to get some food. 
            He was very hungry and desperately in search of food. He searched everywhere, but 
            couldn’t find anything that he could eat. His stomach was rumbling and his search 
            continued. Soon he reached a vineyard which was laden with juicy grapes. The fox 
            looked around to check if he was safe from the hunters. No one was around, so he 
            decided to steal some grapes. He jumped high and high, but he couldn’t reach the 
            grapes. The grapes were too high but he refused to give up. The fox jumped high 
            in the air to catch the grapes in his mouth, but he missed. He tried once more 
            but missed again. He tried a few more times, but couldn’t reach. It was getting 
            dark and the fox was getting angry. His legs hurt, so he gave up in the end. Walking 
            away, he said, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”
            <b><h3>Moral of the story</h3></b>
            We pretend to hate something when we can’t have it.
