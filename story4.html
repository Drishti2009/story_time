        <p>Once upon a time, three neighbours living in a village were having trouble with their 
            crops. Each of the neighbours had one field, but the crops on their fields were infested 
            with pests and were wilting. Every day, they would come up with different ideas to help 
            their crops. The first one tried using a scarecrow in his field, the second used pesticides, 
            and the third built a fence on his field, all to no avail.
            <br>
            One day, the village head came by and called the three farmers. He gave them each a stick 
            and asked them to break it. The farmers could break them easily. He then gave them a bundle 
            of three sticks, and again, asked them to break it. This time, the farmers struggled to break 
            the sticks. The village head said, “Together, you are stronger and work better than you do it 
            alone.” The farmers understood what the village head was saying. They pooled in their resources 
            and got rid of the pests from their fields.
            <b><h3>Moral of the story</h3></b>
            There is strength in unity.
