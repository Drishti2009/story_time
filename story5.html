        <br>
        <p>On a hot scorching day of summer, an ant was walking around in search of water. 
            After walking around for some time, she saw a river and was delighted to see it. 
            She climbed up on a small rock to drink the water, but she slipped and fell into the 
            river. She was drowning but a dove who was sitting on a nearby tree helped her. Seeing 
            the ant in trouble, the dove quickly dropped a leaf into the water. The ant moved towards 
            the leaf and climbed up on it. The dove then carefully pulled the leaf out and placed it 
            on the land. This way, the antâ€™s life was saved and she was forever indebted to the dove.
            <br>
            The ant and the dove became the best of friends and days passed happily. However, one 
            day, a hunter arrived at the forest. He saw the beautiful dove sitting on the tree and 
            aimed his gun at the dove. The ant, who was saved the dove saw this and bit on the heel 
            of the hunter. He shouted from the pain and dropped the gun. The dove was alarmed by the 
            voice of the hunter and realised what could have happened with him. He flew away!
            <b><h3>Moral of the story</h3></b>
            A good deed never goes unrewarded.
