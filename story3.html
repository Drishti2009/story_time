        <p>One day, a selfish fox invited a stork for dinner. Stork was very happy with 
            the invitation – she reached the fox’s home on time and knocked at the door 
            with her long beak. The fox took her to the dinner table and served some soup 
            in shallow bowls for both of them. As the bowl was too shallow for the stork, 
            she couldn’t have soup at all. But, the fox licked up his soup quickly.
        <br>
        The stork was angry and upset, but she didn’t show her anger and behaved politely. 
        To teach a lesson to the fox, she then invited him for dinner the next day. She too 
        served soup, but this time the soup was served in two tall narrow vases. The stork 
        devoured the soup from her vase, but the fox couldn’t drink any of it because of his 
        narrow neck. The fox realised his mistake and went home famished.
        <b><h3>Moral of the story</h3></b>
        A selfish act backfires sooner or later!
