        <p>A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down his body
             just for fun. This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry. He was about
             to eat the mouse when the mouse desperately requested the lion to set him free. “I 
             promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The lion laughed 
             at the mouse’s confidence and let him go
            <br>
            One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with them. They tied him 
            up against a tree. The lion was struggling to get out and started to whimper. Soon, the
            mouse walked past and noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the 
            ropes to set the lion free. Both of them sped off into the jungle.
