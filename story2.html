        <br>
        <p>In a village, lived a carefree boy with his father. The boy’s father told him that he was
           old enough to watch over the sheep while they graze in the fields. Every day, he had to
           take the sheep to the grassy fields and watch them as they graze. However, the boy was
           unhappy and didn’t want to take the sheep to the fields. He wanted to run and play, 
           not watch the boring sheep graze in the field. So, he decided to have some fun. He cried,
           “Wolf! Wolf!” until the entire village came running with stones to chase away the wolf
            before it could eat any of the sheep. When the villagers saw that there was no wolf,
            they left muttering under their breath about how the boy had wasted their time. 
           The next day, the boy cried once more, “Wolf! Wolf!” and, again, the villagers rushed
            there to chase the wolf away.
            <br>
            The boy laughed at the fright he had caused. This time, the villagers left angrily. 
            The third day, as the boy went up the small hill, he suddenly saw a wolf attacking his
             sheep. He cried as hard as he could, “Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!”, but not a single villager came
              to help him. The villagers thought that he was trying to fool them again and did not come
               to rescue him or his sheep. The little boy lost many sheep that day, all because of his
                foolishness.
                <b><h3>Moral of the Story</h3></b>
                It is difficult to trust people who lie, so it’s important to always be truthful.
